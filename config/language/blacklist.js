  This blacklist lists all the language codes we exclude for import in to placeholder.

  The whosonfirst dataset contains many disused and rarely-used languages which
  can cause issues when the source data has been machine transiliterated.

  The list is non-exhaustive and was originally sourced from wikipedia and various
  online sources, I aimed to include the most commonly spoken languages worldwide.

  If you feel a language code is wrong or missing, please feel free to edit this file.
